# HTML Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up the Klecks project by removing unnecessary HTML files and consolidating functionality.

## Files Removed
- `src/help.html` - 498 lines of help documentation
- `src/dev-with-ui.html` - 262 lines of development UI wrapper  
- `test-drawing.html` - 348 lines of drawing system test interface
- `examples/embed/example.html` - Embed usage example
- `examples/headless/basic-usage.html` - 331 lines of headless API demo

## Files Remaining
- `src/index.html` - Main application entry point (ONLY HTML FILE NEEDED)

## Changes Made

### 1. Help System Modernization
- **Created**: `src/app/script/help-content.ts` - Inlined help content and CSS
- **Created**: `src/app/script/klecks/ui/modals/show-help-modal.ts` - Inline help modal
- **Modified**: `src/app/script/app/kl-app.ts` - Updated help references to use inline modal

### 2. Build Configuration Updates
- **Modified**: `package.json` - Removed build scripts for deleted HTML files
  - Removed: `build:help` script
  - Updated: `start:dev` to use TypeScript entry point directly

### 3. Benefits Achieved
- **Simplified Architecture**: Only one HTML file to maintain
- **Reduced Build Complexity**: No more separate help builds
- **Better Integration**: Help content now loads instantly (no iframe delays)
- **Cleaner Repository**: Removed 1,400+ lines of redundant HTML/JS code
- **Maintained Functionality**: All features preserved, help system improved

### 4. Technical Details
- Help content now inlined as TypeScript constants
- CSS scoped to help modal to prevent conflicts
- External links properly handled with target="_blank"
- Internal anchor navigation preserved
- Dark mode support maintained
- Mobile responsive design preserved

## Verification
✅ Main build (`npm run build`) - Working
✅ Development build (`npm run build:dev`) - Working  
✅ Help functionality - Improved (faster loading, better integration)

## Result
The project now has a clean, maintainable structure with only the essential `index.html` file, while preserving all functionality and improving the user experience.
